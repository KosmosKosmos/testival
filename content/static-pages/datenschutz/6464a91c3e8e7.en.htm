    Data protection
</h2>
<p>
    This template can be used to create a&nbsp;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp;. This also meets the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN">General Data Protection Regulation</a> is a EU law,&nbsp;<strong>which came into force on May 25, 2016</strong>&nbsp;and thus also applies to all EU member states.
</p>
<p>
    Data protection describes the&nbsp;<strong>protection against the improper processing of personal data</strong>&nbsp;as well as the&nbsp;<strong>protection of the right to informational self-determination</strong>. Data protection in Germany is mainly regulated by the two laws General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG-new).
</p>
<p>
    For the lawful processing of personal data, a legal basis in accordance with the GDPR or a declaration of consent from the data subject is required. This applies mainly to data traffic on the Internet.

<p>
    <strong>WHAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What is the GDPR?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN">General Data Protection Regulation</a> is a EU law that sets new standards for data protection in the European Union. This has been mandatory for everyone since May 25, 2018. Basically, in the new <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN">General Data Protection Regulation</a >&nbsp;All processes and requirements for data protection management in companies are regulated. Thus&nbsp;<strong>the General Data Protection Regulation replaces the Federal Data Protection Act and other regulations that previously applied to website operators.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The GDPR&nbsp;<strong>affects all companies</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>that collect and store personal data from employees or customers</strong>. This includes medium-sized companies with their own newsletter as well as agencies, online shops, hosters and freelancers who, for example, track users on their website.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>WHY A PRIVACY STATEMENT?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A&nbsp;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp; (also called a&nbsp;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp;) describes measures that an organization takes to protect the privacy of its customers or users. Personal data collected in this way is particularly worthy of protection. Personal data can be, for example, name, e-mail address and address.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, it is usually explained how this data is collected, used and whether it is passed on to third parties, if any. For example, personal information (name, address, etc.), social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), payments (PayPal, Klarna), registrations, newsletters, data analysis and cookies are regulated.
</p>
<p>
    In general, a high level of data protection should be set to ensure that the&nbsp;<strong>requirements of the law are met.</strong>
