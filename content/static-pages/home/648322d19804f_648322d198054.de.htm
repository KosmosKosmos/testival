<h4>
    CONCEPT
</h4>
<p>
    Testival is a small, cozy and intimate gathering, special in many ways. Itâ€™s not a non stop party site, but a magical place where things are balanced and where we really open our ways to our true Self, where we enjoy and celebrate life in a healthy way. And dive ourselves into carefully handpicked beautiful music at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    The concept is different than most festivals. Our festival is small, accepting no more than 700 people. It is very cozy, there are no long distances to cross inside the venue. The festival lasts for a whole week which is not common for small festivals. All this creates a very unique intimate vibe, people get really connected, the idea is that in this week everybody meets everybody else.
</p>
<p>
    Days are filled with music, workshops and hiking tours and evenings get longer as the week progresses.
</p>
<p>
    This way, you can have a good rest in the nights to be fresh for the next day and also you get a good dose of partying.
