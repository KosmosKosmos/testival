<p>
    The imprint is a legally required indication of the origin of the identity of the publisher.
</p>
<p>
    Anyone who operates a website with a business connection is obliged to create an imprint. Otherwise you risk a warning.&nbsp;<strong>The aim is to ensure a minimum level of transparency and information for the user.</strong>&nbsp;Furthermore, the general information requirements aim to determine the identity of the operator, which should enable the users of the website to be able to take legal action in the event of a dispute.

    <strong>HOW WILL WE USE THE DOCUMENT?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The template adapts automatically to the personal information. For this it is necessary that there is clarity about the correctness of the information. Depending on the legal form of the provider, the information can be determined more precisely and tailored to the various requirements of the area of activity. A provider identifier must contain the following data, for example: name and personal information of the operator, information on tax information, addresses, licenses and arbitration.
</p>
<p>
    The provisions of the Telemedia Act require that the information in the imprint must be easily recognizable, directly accessible and constantly available for the user.&nbsp;<strong>Accordingly, the imprint should be placed in such a way that every user can easily find it on the website.< /strong>&nbsp;The simplest solution is to enter the imprint under the term "Imprint" and to keep the number of links that lead to the imprint as low as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore&nbsp;<strong>an e-mail address should be provided to enable quick and direct contact.</strong>
